# Advent-of-Code-2022
My answers for Advent of Code 2022, mainly written in Python. 
Daily coding puzzles at: https://adventofcode.com counting down to Christmas.
Each folder contains the solutions for parts 1 and 2 as sol1.py and sol2.py, the input file is input.txt.

I didn't finish all of the puzzles, made it to about day 15, will update others when completed.
First answers few were written in Java, then switched over to Python soon after.
